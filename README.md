# cancer_mutation_analysis_and_risk_prediction

This project involves analysing the mutations present in the genes of a human body that affects cancer devolopment. Leveraging the use of bioinformatic tools and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to solve the imbalanced classification problem we attain a proper dataset that was furthur used in modeling procedure. ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is used to train the data and provide the significant results across the data.
